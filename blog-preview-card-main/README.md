## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Figtree)

### What I learned

During this project, I reinforced key frontend skills and layout techniques. Here are some specific takeaways:

- How to center and style a card layout using margins, padding, and border-radius.
- Using `box-shadow` and `border` for a visually lifted card effect.
- Creating responsive, hover-interactive elements with smooth transitions.
- Leveraging Flexbox for easy horizontal alignment in the author section.

#### Sample code

```css
h4:hover {
  cursor: pointer;
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
}
.author {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 10px;
}

```

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Explore accessibility best practices 

- Learn about component libraries or utility-first CSS like Tailwind.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs]() – For layout and CSS reference.

- [Google Fonts]() - Figtree – Used for modern font styling.

- [Frontend Mentor]() – For continuous real-world practice projects.
