- How to import and apply Google Fonts properly via `@import`

#### Example Code Snippet
```html
div class="container ">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
          <img src="images/illustration-mockups.svg" alt="Illustration" class="img-fluid">
      </div>
      <div class="text col-5 ">
          <h3>Build The Community<br>Your Fans Will Love</h3>
          <p>Huddle re-imagines the way we build communities. You have a voice, but so does your audience. Create connections with your users as you engage in genuine discussion.</p>
          <button type="button" class="btn">Register</button>
      </div>
    </div>    
  </div>
```
```css

.btn {
    font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
    width: 12em;
    height: 50px;
    border-radius: 50px;
    background-color: white;
    color: hsl(257, 40%, 49%);
    border: none;
}

.btn:hover {
    background-color: hsl(300, 69%, 71%);
    color: white;
}
```

### 📈 Continued Development

In the future, I would like to:

- Add animation effects to icons and buttons
- Make the layout even more mobile-friendly with media queries
- Convert this into a React component for practice
